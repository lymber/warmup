# The warmup project

## Objectives

The main objective of the `warmup` project is to simply create a benchmark
system very similar to [NBench][0], but with the difference of being Free
Software, so that it can be redistributed by distributions.

One intention is to serve as a way to compare the processing speed of
different architectures and give at least *partial* answers to basic
questions like:

* "Should I run a 32 bit distribution or a 64 bit one with my computer?"
* "I just bought a new computer. Is it faster than my older one?"
* "How fast/slow is this ARM CPU compared to my desktop?"
* "Compiler X was just released today. Does it generate faster programs than
  compiler Y?"

There is, of course, no one-size-fits-all solution, but since one of the
first things that we want is to know the CPU/processing speed of programs,
that's what we want for this project.

We deliberately and completely ignore things like peripherals (network
cards, disks etc.), at least for the moment.
